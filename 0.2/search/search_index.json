In contrast to other primer-removal tools, AmpliGone does not actively look for primer sequences within the NGS reads. Instead, reads are trimmed based on primer sequence coordinates in relation to a given reference sequence. Additionally, AmpliGone is able to compensate for, and therefore properly clean, reads that start or end outside of a primer-region as this is a common occurrence in amplicon-based sequencing data. AmpliGone works with Nanopore and Illumina data (Fastq) and supports various 'amplicon-types' to be accurately cleaned.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#ampligone","text":"AmpliGone is a tool which accurately finds and removes primer sequences from NGS reads in an amplicon experiment.
