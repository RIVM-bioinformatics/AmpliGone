In contrast to a lot of other primer-removal tools, AmpliGone does not actively look for primer sequences within the NGS reads. Instead, reads are trimmed based on primer sequence coordinates in relation to a given reference sequence. Additionally, AmpliGone is able to compensate for, and therefore properly clean, reads that start or end outside of a primer-region as this is a common occurrence in amplicon-based sequencing data. AmpliGone is build and tested with Nanopore and Illumina data (fastq) in mind and supports both 'end-to-end' as well as 'end-to-mid' amplicons to be cleaned.

MacOS may also work but is not tested. AmpliGone will not work on Windows. AmpliGone will be made available for installation through Conda and pip. However, this is currently not yet working. We will update these docs when installation through Conda and/or pip is available. Prerequisites \u00b6 AmpliGone requires Python 3.7 or later to be installed on your system (or in an environment). Other dependencies will be installed during the installation, you don't have to install them manually. These extra dependencies are as follows: pysam>=0.16 pandas>=1.2.3 numpy>=1.20 mappy>=2.17 biopython>=1.78 parmap>=1.5.2 tqdm>=4.59.0 We strongly advise you to use a conda environment (or similar) to make sure there won't be any conflicts in package dependencies. Download and install from source \u00b6 First start by cloning the repository and making sure you're on version 0.2.0 as per this documentation: git clone https://github.com/RIVM-bioinformatics/AmpliGone.git ; cd AmpliGone ; git checkout tags/v0.2.0 You're now in the newly created \"AmpliGone\" directory. Make a new Conda environment before continuing If you have Conda installed on your system, please create and activate a new environment before continuing. Use the following command to create and activate a new Conda environment named \"AmpliGone\" based on the environment-recipe we provide in the github-repository conda env create -f env.yml ; conda activate AmpliGone The \"AmpliGone\" conda-environment should now be active You can now install AmpliGone via the following command: pip install . AmpliGone should now be installed! You can verify if installation was successful by typing ampligone --version on the command-line, this should show the installed AmpliGone version.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installation-instructions","text":"AmpliGone is only available on Linux (or Linux-based) operating systems.
