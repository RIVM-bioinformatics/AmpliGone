In contrast to other primer-removal tools, AmpliGone does not actively look for primer sequences within the NGS reads. Instead, reads are trimmed based on primer sequence coordinates in relation to a given reference sequence. Additionally, AmpliGone is able to compensate for, and therefore properly clean, reads that start or end outside of a primer-region as this is a common occurrence in amplicon-based sequencing data. AmpliGone is build and tested with Nanopore and Illumina data (fastq) in mind and supports both 'end-to-end' as well as 'end-to-mid' amplicons to be cleaned.
