Therefore, the read-mapping settings usually don't need to be adjusted for your data as the existing presets are already fine-tuned for most situations. AmpliGone has a system in place that can assign the best fitting alignment-preset based on your data.</p> <p>However, in certain edge-cases it may be beneficial or necessary to change the preset manually or even make adjustments to the underlying alignment scoring-matrix. These settings can be changed with the <code>--alignment-preset</code> and <code>--alignment-scoring</code> flags respectively.</p> <p>Alignment preset</p> <p>The following 4 read-alignment presets are supported:</p> Preset keyword Intended use sr Short reads with high accuracy map-ont Long reads with lesser accuracy, specifically from the Nanopore platform map-pb PacBio continuous long reads (CLR) splice Long reads with splicing mode enabled <p>When no alignment-preset is given manually, AmpliGone will choose between either the <code>sr</code> or the <code>map-ont</code> preset depending on your input data.</p> <p>The alignment-preset can be set manually by using the <code>--alignment-preset</code> / <code>-ap</code> flag with any of the presets listed above. Example: <code>--alignment-preset sr</code></p> <p>Alignment scoring-matrix</p> <p>When no scoring-matrix is given then the default scoring matrix values will be used that fit the alignment-preset. These default scoring values are most likely fine for the majority of use cases.
